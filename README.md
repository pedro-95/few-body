# few-body Project

#### This repository contains Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks where a nuclear few-body problem is solved for different Well shapes by using a Monte Carlo integration algorithm (See Main Reference).

  - **Report.pdf**: contains a non-published article, which describes the resuts obtained by the code shown in this repository.

  - **few_body.py**: contains all the different functions used to perform the Monte Carlo integration.

  - **Block_Bootstrap.py**: contains all the functions needed for the Simple Block Bootstrap method to estimate uncertainties.

  - **few_body_1_integration.ipynb**: is a notebook where are the integrations performed in the project have been performed.

  - **few_body_2_analysis.ipynb**: is a notebook where all the plots and calculations have been performed.

  - **plots**: folder with all the plots used in Report.pdf.

  - **samples**: folder with all the different samples obtained.
